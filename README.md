# Brazilian restaurant

Brazilian flavour is a web application for typical Brazilian restaurant food, this project I developed with my work partner Raphael Molinaro and this is a very special project for us since we love Brazilian food.
This web application has many functionalities. First the customer start see the home page with the currently weather in Toronto, than they can get know the restaurant story in about us, next step is the login here the customer can fill it out with username and email.
After the login validation the customer can see a lot of information about the restaurant product. In the navigation bar has very valuable information that the client can be interested in see such as price of the product located in order section, here the customer can calculate the price of each product they desire to order with the tax already included.
In navigation bar in the schedule section is possible to see a calendar of the food of the day and details about it, in addition we have functionalities to calculate your BMR in the BMR nav section, the client can also sing up and see where the restaurant is located on sign and also map.
Raphael and I developed this web application using languages and API such as: HTLM, CSS, JavaScript, weather API and google maps API.
