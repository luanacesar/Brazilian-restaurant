# Brazilian restaurant

Brazilian flavour is a web application for typical Brazilian restaurant food. This is a project that I developed with my work partner Raphael Molinaro and this is a very special project for us because we love Brazilian food. This web application has many functionalities. First the customer starts to see the home page with the current weather in Toronto, then they can get to know the restaurants story in the about us section. The next step is the login where the customer can fill it out with their username and email. After the login validation the customer can see information about the restaurant products. In the navigation bar there is important information where the client can see the price of the product which is located in the order section. The customer can calculate the price of each product they want in their order with the tax already included. In the navigation bar in the schedule section, the customer can see a calendar with the food of the day and details about it. We have functionalities to calculate your Body Mass Index  (BMI) in the BMI nav section. The client can also create an account with the restaurant. If the client presses location, they can see the location of the restaurant on google maps. Raphael and I developed this web application using languages and API such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, weather API and google maps API.
